#
# 1. try to get an endpoint specific to your calling class / interface
# 2. if result is empty and if a stage is set, try to get the endpoint for your stage
# 3. if results is still empty, try to get default endpoint
# 4. if result is still empty, throw an IllegalStateException
#
# This way 
# - you will fail early 
# - provide correct default values with a commit and without need 
#   an ops guy to do manual work
# - have your own (in development) classes connect to special endpoints
